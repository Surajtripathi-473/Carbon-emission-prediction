# Carbon Emission Prediction
(https://skill4future.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/skill4future-logo.png)

## Overview

This project aims to predict carbon emissions using data-driven machine learning techniques. Developed as part of the AICTE internship program, in collaboration with [Skill4Future.in](https://skill4future.in/) and [Edunet Foundation](https://edunetfoundation.org/), the project addresses the vital challenge of estimating and potentially reducing carbon footprints in various domains.

## Introduction

Accurate carbon emission prediction is critical for environmental sustainability, policy planning, and industrial compliance. Leveraging machine learning, this project takes in relevant data (such as fuel consumption, vehicle data, or industrial metrics) and predicts the expected carbon emissions.

## Features

- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Implementation of multiple regression models (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest)
- Model evaluation and comparison
- Visualization of data trends and prediction results
- Modular and reusable codebase

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/surajtripathi-473/carbon-emission-prediction.git
   cd carbon-emission-prediction
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r .txt
   ```
   *(Make sure you have Python 3.7+ installed.)*

## Usage

1. **Prepare the dataset:**  
   Place your data file (CSV) in the `data/` directory.

2. **Train the model:**  
   Run the main script to start training and prediction:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

3. **View results:**  
   Output files and prediction graphs will be saved in the `output/` directory.

## Dataset

- The project uses publicly available or provided datasets relevant to carbon emissions (e.g., vehicle emissions, industrial data).
- Ensure your data has the necessary columns (e.g., fuel type, consumption rate, year, etc.).

## Results

- The trained models are evaluated using metrics like RMSE, MAE, and R².
- Visualization of results is available in the output graphs.
- Sample predictions and analysis are included in the `output/` folder.
